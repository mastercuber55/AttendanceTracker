        Firstly, let's discuss this maybe since uhh i can't think all that in my head bruh

        So how this is gonna work is that you give it a initial date, and from it it obtains the dates for the whole week 
        HHEY WAIT A MINUTE, What if the given date isn't the starting date of the week as it would be most likely
        But I still do need it from monday to sunday, so I do need to keep track of actual date system it seems ughh
        so considering that, what if I find out which week does the date belong to then take out every date in that week.

        const monday = new Date(input); // clone input
        monday.setDate(input.getDate() - diff); // adjust to Monday
